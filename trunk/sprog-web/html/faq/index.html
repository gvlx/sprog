<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Sprog</h2>

<p>If you have questions that aren't answered here, the <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sprog-users">mailing
list</a> is the best place to ask.</p>

<h3>What does the name 'Sprog' mean?</h3>

<p>Nothing really - it's just a fun word.  There are a couple of
rationalisations though:</p>

<ul> <li>As a contraction<sup>1</sup> of the words sprocket and cog, Sprog
fits well with the 'machine' metaphor.</li> <li>In some parts of the
english-speaking world, sprog is a colloquial term for child.  Sprog is my
'brain-child' - an idea I've carried around for a long time that's finally 
getting to see the light of day.</li> </ul>

<p>The fact that 'sprog' is also the Danish word for 'language' probably won't
help the project's google ranking :-)</p>

<p><small>1. 'Matt' kindly pointed out that I probably mean <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> rather than
contraction.</small></p>

<h3><a name="automator"></a>Is Sprog inspired by Apple's Automator?</h3>

<p>No, Sprog is not 'inspired' by <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a>.  The
gestation period for Sprog was six or seven years but the first public 
release was in late 2004.</p>

<p>Automator does look cool though and there are some uncanny similarities in
the user interfaces of the two apps.  Of course automator is streets ahead in
actual functionality - I'm really just getting started with Sprog.</p>

<h3><a name="connect_gears"></a>How Do I Connect Gears Together?</h3>

<p>Oh dear, the fact that people are having trouble working this out clearly
shows it's a shortcoming in the design.  This will be fixed in a future release.
Until then, here are the two secrets you need to know...</p>

<ol>
<li>If you want to connect Gear B onto the output of Gear A, then you need to
drag B and drop it on A - moving the connectors close together won't work and
moving Gear A won't work.</li>
<li>When you drop Gear B, it's top left corner must fall within the outline of
Gear A - it won't work if you drop it even slightly to far to the left.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, sorry for the frustration this has caused people.  I will rework
the code so that gears snap together when moved close.</p>
