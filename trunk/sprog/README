WARNING

This is a 'pre-alpha' release, of 'Sprog', which means:

    * the code has bugs
    * API's are subject to change without notice


DESCRIPTION

Sprog is a GUI tool for building pipelines to process data. It allows you to
select a data source; hook up some filter components and an output component;
then feed your data through - all by pointing and clicking.

In Sprog jargon, the components are called 'gears' and the assembled result is
called a 'machine'. Sprog ships with a number of pre-written gears - most of
which are configurable. It's relatively straightforward to write your own gears
using the supplied framework. This allows you to make reusable components for
the data transformations you use most often.


PREREQUISITES

prerequisites:
