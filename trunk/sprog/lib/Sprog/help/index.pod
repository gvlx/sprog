=head2 Welcome to Sprog

I<Sprog> is a tool for working with data.  It allows you to do all the things
those clever Unix geeks can do with their cryptic command lines but you can now
do it all with point-n-click and drag-n-drop.

A Sprog I<machine> has many similarities to a shell script.  It is built from
small reusable parts (called I<gears>) that are connected together to filter
and massage your data.  Once you have built a machine, you can save it and run
it again and again to automatically perform repetitive tasks.

=head2 Building a Machine

The first step in building a machine to to display the I<palette>.  You can show
or hide the palette using the B<F9> key, or using the palette button on the
toolbar.

Next, drag gears from the palette to the workbench.  To connect gears together
simply drop one gear on top of another - if the input and output connectors
match then the gear you dropped should snap into place below the other.

Each gear has its own properties dialog with options to change the gear's
behaviour.  To configure a gear, right-click and select I<Properties> from the
pop-up menu.
