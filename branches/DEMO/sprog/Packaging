This file contains information for people who are packaging Sprog for different
operating system distributions.

Although building a Sprog machine requires a GUI, it is possible to run (some)
machines in 'no GUI' mode.  Therefore, consideration should be given to 
splitting the distribution into two packages:

  sprog-base
  sprog

Currently the GUI-specific files are:

  lib/Sprog/Gtk*
  lib/Sprog/HelpParser.pm


DEPENDENCIES

Sprog itself is written in Perl (no XS).  It requires Perl 5.8.x.

The sprog-base package would depend on the following CPAN modules:

  Glib            1.081
  YAML            0.38

The sprog package would depend on the following CPAN modules:

  Gtk2            1.081
  Gnome2::Canvas  1.002
  Gtk2::GladeXML  1.003
  Pod::Simple     3.02

The CPAN modules have library dependencies.


GEAR DEPENDENCIES

A number of gear classes are included in the Sprog distribution.  Many of those
classes will have dependencies on CPAN modules and libaries not listed above.
Those additional packages SHOULD NOT be indicated as dependencies for either
the sprog-base or sprog packages.  The gears themselves SHOULD be included in
the sprog-base package.  This implies that gear classes will be installed
that may not be functional.  Sprog will develop capabilities for dealing with
this situation.


PACKAGING OF ADDITIONAL GEARS

Conventions for packaging third-party gear classes have not been established
yet.  If you have suggestions, please bring them to the sprog-users mailing
list.
